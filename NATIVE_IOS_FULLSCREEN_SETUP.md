# Native iOS Fullscreen Configuration for Bean Stalker

## Current Status
The Bean Stalker iOS app has been configured for native fullscreen display on iPhone devices.

## Key Native iOS Configurations Applied:

### 1. iOS Info.plist Configuration
```xml
<key>UIRequiresFullScreen</key>
<true/>
<key>UIStatusBarHidden</key>
<false/>
<key>UIStatusBarStyle</key>
<string>UIStatusBarStyleLightContent</string>
```

### 2. Capacitor Configuration (capacitor.config.ts)
```typescript
ios: {
  contentInset: 'automatic',
  scrollEnabled: true,
  allowsLinkPreview: false,
  backgroundColor: '#1B3C2A'
}
```

### 3. Native CSS Adaptations
Updated `.iphone-fullscreen` class to use native safe area handling:
- Uses `env(safe-area-inset-*)` for proper iPhone notch/Dynamic Island support
- Native viewport units (100vh, 100dvh) for true fullscreen display
- Hardware acceleration for smooth native performance

## For TestFlight Deployment:
1. The configuration changes are included in the iOS project
2. Running `npx cap sync ios` applies these changes
3. GitHub Actions workflow will build with these native settings
4. TestFlight app will display in true fullscreen without black bars

## Difference from Web Version:
- Native iOS apps don't use browser viewport meta tags
- Uses native iOS plist configuration instead
- Leverages Capacitor's native bridge for fullscreen handling
- Proper safe area integration for modern iPhone models

The app is now configured for native iOS fullscreen display.
