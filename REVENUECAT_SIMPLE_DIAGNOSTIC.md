# Simple RevenueCat Diagnostic Test

## Issue: Complex diagnostic failing due to TypeScript errors

The enhanced diagnostic has TypeScript property access issues. Let me create a simplified version that focuses on the core issue.

## Root Cause Analysis

The "0 products found" issue is likely:
1. **RevenueCat SDK not properly initialized**
2. **API key not reaching the native app** 
3. **Offering configuration mismatch**
4. **App Store Connect sync delay**

## Simplified Diagnostic

I'm creating a basic diagnostic that:
- ✅ Tests if RevenueCat initializes
- ✅ Checks API key presence  
- ✅ Gets raw offerings data
- ✅ Shows platform detection
- ✅ Avoids complex property access

## Expected Results

**Working:**
```
Platform: Native
API Key: true
Initialization: success
Total offerings: 1
Current offering: default
Products found: 4
```

**Broken:**
```
Platform: Native  
API Key: true/false
Initialization: failed/success
Total offerings: 0
Current offering: None
Products found: 0
```

This simplified approach will identify the exact failure point without TypeScript complications.
