# RevenueCat Products Setup Issue

## Current Status: API Key Working ✅ Products Missing ⚠️

The diagnostic shows:
- ✅ RevenueCat API Key: success - API key configured
- ✅ IAP Service Initialization: success  
- ✅ User Login: success
- ✅ IAP Availability: success
- ⚠️ **Product Loading: Found 0 products (warning)**

## Root Cause: Product Configuration Mismatch

The RevenueCat SDK is working but can't find the products. This indicates:
1. Products exist in App Store Connect but not configured in RevenueCat Dashboard
2. Product IDs don't match between App Store Connect and RevenueCat
3. Products aren't in "Ready to Submit" status in App Store Connect

## Expected Products Configuration

### App Store Connect Products (should exist):
- `com.beanstalker.credit25` - $25 Credit Package
- `com.beanstalker.credit50` - $50 Credit Package  
- `com.beanstalker.credit100` - $100 Credit Package
- `com.beanstalker.membership69` - $69 Premium Membership

### RevenueCat Dashboard Requirements:
1. Go to RevenueCat Dashboard → Products
2. Each App Store Connect product must be added to RevenueCat
3. Product IDs must match exactly
4. Products must be associated with the "Beanstalker (App Store)" app

## Fix Options

### Option 1: Configure Products in RevenueCat Dashboard
1. Login to RevenueCat Dashboard
2. Go to Projects → Beanstalker → Products
3. Add products with exact IDs:
   - `com.beanstalker.credit25`
   - `com.beanstalker.credit50` 
   - `com.beanstalker.credit100`
   - `com.beanstalker.membership69`

### Option 2: Verify App Store Connect
1. Login to App Store Connect
2. Go to Apps → Bean Stalker → Features → In-App Purchases
3. Verify all 4 products exist and are "Ready to Submit"
4. Check product IDs match exactly

### Option 3: Check RevenueCat Offerings (Most Likely Issue)
1. RevenueCat Dashboard → Offerings
2. Create an offering called "default" 
3. Add all 4 products to the default offering
4. Products won't appear in SDK without being in an offering

## Expected Result After Fix
Diagnostic should show:
- ✅ Product Loading: Found 4 products
- Credit packages should appear in Buy Credits interface
- Test purchases should work with sandbox Apple ID

## Current Bean Stalker Product Structure
Based on the app configuration:
- $25 → $29.50 credits (+$4.50 bonus)
- $50 → $59.90 credits (+$9.90 bonus)  
- $100 → $120.70 credits (+$20.70 bonus)
- $69 Premium Membership (one-time)

The most likely issue is that products need to be added to a RevenueCat "Offering" to be discoverable by the SDK.
