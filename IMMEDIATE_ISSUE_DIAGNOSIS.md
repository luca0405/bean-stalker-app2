# IMMEDIATE ISSUE DIAGNOSIS

## What's Working ✅
- **Webhook**: Successfully processes com.beanstalker.membership69 → 69 credits
- **Backend**: User 40 now has 295.5 credits (multiple successful transactions)
- **Product IDs**: Correctly configured for exact RevenueCat product identifiers
- **Database**: All transactions properly recorded

## What Needs Investigation ❓

Please clarify what specifically is not working:

1. **Native Apple Pay Popup**
   - Does the Apple Pay popup appear in TestFlight app?
   - Are you testing on a physical iPhone with TestFlight?

2. **Product Loading in App**
   - Do the credit packages ($25, $50, $100) show up in the Buy Credits screen?
   - Does the membership option appear during registration?

3. **Authentication Issues**
   - Can you log in successfully in TestFlight app?
   - Is Face ID/biometric authentication working?

4. **Purchase Flow**
   - Do purchases complete but no credits are added?
   - Do purchases fail immediately?
   - Do you get error messages?

## Critical Questions to Resolve:

1. **Are you testing in the TestFlight app on iPhone?** (Required for native payments)
2. **What specific error messages do you see?**
3. **At what point does the process fail?** (Login, product loading, payment popup, credit addition)

## Immediate Actions Needed:

Based on your answer, I will:
- Fix the specific failing component
- Deploy the corrected version to TestFlight immediately
- Verify the complete end-to-end flow works

The backend is proven working. I need to identify the specific frontend/native issue to resolve it immediately.
