# RevenueCat Offerings Configuration Fix

## CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE: Offerings Configuration Error

Based on your TestFlight diagnostic results:
- ✅ Platform: Native (iOS/Android) 
- ✅ API Key Present: true
- ✅ Service Initialized: true
- ❌ **RevenueCat API Call: FAILED - "There is an issue with your offerings configuration"**

## The Real Problem

The issue is NOT with App Store Connect (your products are correct). The problem is with **RevenueCat Dashboard offerings configuration**.

## Immediate Fix Required

### Step 1: Verify Offering Setup in RevenueCat Dashboard
1. Go to **RevenueCat Dashboard** → **Offerings**
2. Check if "default" offering exists and is **ACTIVE**
3. Verify all 4 products are added to the offering:
   - com.beanstalker.credit25
   - com.beanstalker.credit50  
   - com.beanstalker.credit100
   - com.beanstalker.membership69

### Step 2: Check Package Identifiers
The offering packages must have specific identifiers. Verify:
- **Package 1**: credit_25 → com.beanstalker.credit25
- **Package 2**: credit_50 → com.beanstalker.credit50
- **Package 3**: credit_100 → com.beanstalker.credit100
- **Package 4**: membership → com.beanstalker.membership69

### Step 3: Offering Status
- Offering must be **ACTIVE** (not draft)
- Offering must be set as **CURRENT** offering
- Products must be properly linked to packages

### Step 4: App Configuration
- Bundle ID: com.beanstalker.member (confirmed correct)
- App must be in **PRODUCTION** mode (not sandbox)

## Common Offering Issues

1. **Draft Offering**: Offering exists but not activated
2. **Missing Current Offering**: No offering set as current
3. **Wrong Package Identifiers**: Packages don't match expected names
4. **Product Not Linked**: Products exist but not added to packages
5. **Bundle ID Mismatch**: Wrong app selected in RevenueCat

## Verification Steps

After fixing the offerings:
1. Wait 5-10 minutes for changes to propagate
2. Run TestFlight diagnostic again
3. Should show: "✅ RevenueCat API Call: SUCCESS"
4. Should show: "Total offerings found: 1"
5. Should show: "Current offering: default"

## Expected Working Result
