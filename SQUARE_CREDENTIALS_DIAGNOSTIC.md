# Square Credentials Diagnostic Report

## Current Status Summary
Your Square credentials are **sandbox credentials** with a location mismatch issue.

## What's Working ✅
- Square access token is valid
- Sandbox API connection successful
- Found working location: `LKTZKDFJ44YZD` (Default Test Account, Australia)

## What's Not Working ❌
- Configured location `LRQ926HVH9WFD` is not accessible with current token
- Environment is SANDBOX, not PRODUCTION
- Kitchen Display System failing due to location authorization error

## Test Results
- **Sandbox API**: ✅ Working (`https://connect.squareupsandbox.com`)
- **Production API**: ❌ Unauthorized (`https://connect.squareup.com`)
- **Current Location**: `LKTZKDFJ44YZD` (Australian test account)
- **Configured Location**: `LRQ926HVH9WFD` (Not authorized)

## Immediate Fix Options

### Option 1: Use Working Sandbox Location
Update Replit environment to use the working location:
```
SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=LKTZKDFJ44YZD
```

### Option 2: Switch to Production Credentials
Update all Square credentials to production values:
- Get production access token from Square Developer Dashboard
- Get production application ID
- Get production location ID
- Update webhook signature key

## Next Steps Needed
1. **For immediate testing**: Use `LKTZKDFJ44YZD` as location
2. **For production**: Get production Square credentials from Square Developer Dashboard
3. **Update Replit secrets** with correct values
4. **Update GitHub secrets** for native app builds

Would you like me to:
A) Fix the location to use the working sandbox location for testing?
B) Help you switch to production credentials?
C) Both - fix sandbox first, then guide production setup?
