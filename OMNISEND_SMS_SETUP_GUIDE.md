# Omnisend SMS Setup Guide for Bean Stalker Native App

## Current Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Implementation

The Omnisend integration is **technically working** but requires additional setup in the Omnisend dashboard to send actual SMS messages.

### What's Working ‚úÖ
- Omnisend API connection established
- Contacts being created successfully in Omnisend
- Custom events being triggered
- Phone numbers properly formatted for international use

### What's Missing ‚ö†Ô∏è
- SMS campaign automation setup in Omnisend dashboard
- Event-triggered SMS workflow configuration

## How Omnisend SMS Actually Works

Omnisend is primarily an **email marketing automation platform** that also supports SMS. It doesn't provide direct SMS sending via API like Twilio. Instead, it requires:

1. **Contact Creation** ‚Üí ‚úÖ Implemented
2. **Campaign Setup** ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual dashboard configuration required  
3. **Event Triggering** ‚Üí ‚úÖ Implemented

## Required Setup in Omnisend Dashboard

### Step 1: Create SMS Automation Workflow

1. **Login to Omnisend Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://app.omnisend.com

2. **Create New Automation**
   - Navigate: Automations ‚Üí Create Automation
   - Choose: "Custom Event" trigger

3. **Configure Event Trigger**
   - Event Name: `credit_share`
   - Trigger Conditions: When this event occurs

4. **Add SMS Action**
   - Add Action: Send SMS
   - SMS Content: Use dynamic properties from event
   ```
   üéÅ You've received ${{credit_amount}} Bean Stalker credits from {{sender}}! 
   Show this code at our store: {{verification_code}}. 
   Valid for 24 hours. Bean Stalker Coffee Shop
   ```

5. **Activate Automation**
   - Review and activate the workflow

### Step 2: SMS Sender ID Configuration

1. **Configure SMS Settings**
   - Go to: Settings ‚Üí SMS
   - Set up sender name: "Bean Stalker"
   - Configure compliance settings for Australia

2. **Test SMS Sending**
   - Use test contact to verify SMS delivery
   - Check delivery rates and costs

## Alternative: Direct SMS Service Integration

For **immediate SMS functionality** without Omnisend dashboard setup, consider integrating:

### Option A: Twilio SMS API
- Direct SMS sending capability
- Per-message pricing
- Immediate implementation

### Option B: AWS SNS
- Cost-effective for Australian numbers
- Direct API integration
- No campaign setup required

### Option C: MessageBird SMS
- International SMS support
- Simple REST API
- Good Australian coverage

## Current Implementation Impact

### For Development/Testing
- ‚úÖ Contacts are being added to Omnisend
- ‚úÖ Events are being triggered
- ‚ö†Ô∏è SMS not sent until campaign is configured

### For Production Native App
- ‚úÖ Form shows success message
- ‚úÖ Credits are deducted correctly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Recipients don't receive SMS until Omnisend campaign is active

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Manual SMS Fallback)
1. Keep current Omnisend integration for contact management
2. Show manual SMS option when Omnisend automation isn't configured
3. Users can send SMS manually via device messaging app

### Short-term (Complete Omnisend Setup)
1. Configure SMS automation in Omnisend dashboard
2. Test SMS delivery with real phone numbers
3. Monitor delivery rates and costs

### Long-term (Direct SMS Service)
1. Evaluate SMS volume and costs
2. Consider migrating to Twilio/AWS SNS for direct control
3. Keep Omnisend for email marketing automation

## Current Code Status

The Bean Stalker app currently:
- ‚úÖ Attempts Omnisend SMS automation
- ‚úÖ Falls back to manual SMS if Omnisend fails
- ‚úÖ Provides clear user feedback
- ‚úÖ Handles errors gracefully

This hybrid approach ensures the app works immediately while allowing for future SMS automation once the Omnisend dashboard is configured.
