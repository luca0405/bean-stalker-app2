# RevenueCat Connection Status

## ✅ API Key Configuration Complete

The RevenueCat API key has been successfully configured in your environment. 

## Next Steps:

### 1. Deploy Updated iOS App
Your GitHub Actions workflow is now configured to include the RevenueCat API key during the build process. 

**To deploy:**
1. Push your changes to GitHub repository: `luca0405/bean-stalker-app2`
2. Go to GitHub → Actions → Run "iOS Build - Simple Fix" workflow
3. Wait for build completion (~20-30 minutes)
4. Install updated TestFlight build

### 2. Test with Diagnostic Tool
Once you install the updated TestFlight build:

1. Open Bean Stalker app
2. Go to **Buy Credits**
3. Tap **"Diagnostic"** tab  
4. Tap **"Run Diagnostics"**

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Platform Check: Native iOS
- ✅ RevenueCat API Key: Configured  
- ✅ IAP Service Initialization: Success
- ✅ User Login: Success
- ✅ Product Loading: Found 4 products
- ✅ IAP Availability: Available

### 3. RevenueCat API Key Details
To verify you're using the correct key, check that your RevenueCat API key:
- Starts with `appl_` (for iOS)
- Is the **Public SDK Key** (not the Secret Key)
- Comes from: RevenueCat Dashboard → Project Settings → API Keys

### 4. Sandbox Testing Setup
After the diagnostic passes:
1. Sign out from real Apple ID in Settings → App Store  
2. Don't sign in with sandbox Apple ID yet
3. Attempt IAP purchase in Bean Stalker app
4. When prompted, sign in with sandbox Apple ID
5. Complete test purchase (no real money charged)

## Current Status Summary:
- ✅ RevenueCat API key configured
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow updated
- ✅ Diagnostic tool ready
- ⏳ Awaiting iOS build deployment
- ⏳ Ready for sandbox testing

The "Payment system not available" error should be resolved once you deploy the updated app with the properly configured RevenueCat API key.
