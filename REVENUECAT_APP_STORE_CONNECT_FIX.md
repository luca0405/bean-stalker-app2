# RevenueCat App Store Connect Integration Fix

## Issue: 0 Products Found Despite Correct Configuration

Products are "Ready to Submit" and added to RevenueCat "default" offering, but still 0 products found. This indicates an App Store Connect integration issue.

## Root Cause: Missing App Store Connect API Key in RevenueCat

RevenueCat needs an App Store Connect API key to fetch products from Apple's servers. Without this, it cannot see your products even if they're configured correctly.

## Solution: Configure App Store Connect Integration

### Step 1: Create App Store Connect API Key
1. Go to **App Store Connect** → **Users and Access** → **Keys**
2. Click **Generate API Key** (or use existing one)
3. **Name**: "RevenueCat Integration"
4. **Access**: **App Manager** or **Admin** (needs product access)
5. **Download the .p8 key file** (you can only download once!)
6. **Copy the Key ID** (appears after creation)

### Step 2: Configure RevenueCat Dashboard
1. Go to **RevenueCat Dashboard** → **Apps** → **Bean Stalker**
2. Click **App Store Connect Integration** section
3. Enter the following:
   - **Issuer ID**: (from App Store Connect → Users and Access → Keys)
   - **Key ID**: (from your API key)
   - **Private Key**: (paste content of .p8 file)
   - **Bundle ID**: com.beanstalker.member
4. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Test Integration
After saving, RevenueCat will test the connection:
- ✅ **Success**: "Connected to App Store Connect"
- ❌ **Error**: Shows specific error message

## Expected Values You Need

### From App Store Connect → Users and Access → Keys:
- **Issuer ID**: (UUID format like: 69a6de8b-1234-5678-9abc-def012345678)
- **Key ID**: (10 characters like: ABCD123456)
- **Private Key**: (Contents of downloaded .p8 file)

### Bundle ID Verification:
- **App Store Connect**: com.beanstalker.member
- **RevenueCat Dashboard**: com.beanstalker.member
- **iOS Project**: com.beanstalker.member

## After Integration Setup

Once App Store Connect integration is configured:
1. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for RevenueCat to sync
2. **Test diagnostic again** - should show 4 products
3. **RevenueCat will automatically fetch** your products from App Store Connect

## Verification Steps

### Check Integration Status:
1. RevenueCat Dashboard → Apps → Bean Stalker
2. Look for **"App Store Connect: Connected"** status
3. Verify products appear in **Products** section

### Common Issues:
- **Invalid Key**: Key doesn't have proper permissions
- **Wrong Bundle ID**: Mismatch between platforms
- **Expired Key**: API key has been revoked
- **Missing Permissions**: Key needs App Manager access

## This Should Fix the 0 Products Issue

The App Store Connect integration is the missing link between your "Ready to Submit" products and RevenueCat's ability to see them.
