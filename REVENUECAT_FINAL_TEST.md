# RevenueCat Final Integration Test

## Status: Products Ready ✅

All 4 App Store Connect products are now "Ready to Submit":
- ✅ $100 Credit (com.beanstalker.credit100) - Ready to Submit
- ✅ $25 Credit (com.beanstalker.credit25) - Ready to Submit  
- ✅ $50 Credit (com.beanstalker.credit50) - Ready to Submit
- ✅ Beanstalker Membership (com.beanstalker.membership69) - Ready to Submit

## App "Draft" Status is Normal
The "Draft" status shown in main App Store Connect interface refers to your overall app submission, not the IAP products. IAP products can be "Ready to Submit" while the main app is in "Draft" - this is the correct configuration.

## Final Test Steps
1. Wait 10-15 minutes for App Store Connect propagation
2. Open Bean Stalker TestFlight app
3. Navigate to Buy Credits → Diagnostic tab
4. Run diagnostic test

## Expected Results
**Before Fix:** Found 0 products (configuration error)
**After Fix:** Found 4 products (integration working)

The diagnostic should now show:
```
✅ RevenueCat API Key: success
✅ IAP Service Initialization: success  
✅ User Login: success
✅ IAP Availability: success
✅ Product Loading: Found 4 products
```

## If Successful
Your complete IAP system will be operational:
- Credit purchases through App Store
- RevenueCat webhook processing  
- Automatic credit balance updates
- Real sandbox testing ready
- Production deployment ready

## Next Phase After Success
- Real sandbox Apple ID testing
- GitHub Actions iOS build with working IAP
- TestFlight distribution to users
- Production App Store submission

The IAP integration will be 100% complete and functional.
