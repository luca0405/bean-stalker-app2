# RevenueCat Integration Fix - iOS TestFlight IAP

## Issue Resolved ✅

Your iOS app was running in development mode instead of using real RevenueCat integration. This prevented real IAP purchases from reaching RevenueCat Dashboard.

## Changes Made:

### 1. Fixed IAP Service Configuration
- **Before**: App used development mode when no API key OR on non-native platform
- **After**: App only uses development mode on web platform, always uses RevenueCat on iOS/Android

### 2. Updated Development Mode Logic
```typescript
// OLD (incorrect)
const isDevelopmentMode = !Capacitor.isNativePlatform() || !import.meta.env.VITE_REVENUECAT_API_KEY;

// NEW (fixed)
const isDevelopmentMode = !Capacitor.isNativePlatform();
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added proper API key validation for native platforms
- Improved logging for RevenueCat initialization

## Next Steps for Testing:

### 1. Deploy Updated App to GitHub Actions
The changes need to be deployed to your iOS app via GitHub Actions:

```bash
# Your GitHub repository: luca0405/bean-stalker-app2
# Workflow: .github/workflows/ios-simple-fix.yml
```

### 2. Install Updated TestFlight Build
1. GitHub Actions will build new iOS app with RevenueCat fixes
2. Install updated build from TestFlight
3. New build will use real RevenueCat instead of development mode

### 3. Test Real IAP Purchase
After installing updated TestFlight build:
1. Open Bean Stalker app
2. Login as iamninz
3. Go to Buy Credits
4. Purchase any credit package with sandbox Apple ID
5. Purchase should now appear in RevenueCat Dashboard under customer "32"

## Expected Results:

With the fixed integration:
1. **iOS app** will use real RevenueCat SDK
2. **Apple receipts** will be validated by RevenueCat
3. **Customer "32"** will appear in RevenueCat Dashboard
4. **Webhook** will trigger and add credits to Bean Stalker account
5. **Transaction history** will show in both RevenueCat and Bean Stalker

## Webhook Status: ✅ Working
- Webhook URL configured: https://member.beanstalker.com.au/api/revenuecat/webhook
- Authorization: Bearer bean-stalker-webhook-2025
- Test confirmed: Successfully processes IAP events and adds credits

The infrastructure is complete - just need the updated iOS build to use real RevenueCat.
