# Square OAuth Access Token Solution

## The Issue
Your Square application is set up as an OAuth application, not a personal access token application. This requires a different approach to get the access token.

## Solution: Get OAuth Access Token

### Option 1: Check for Existing Access Token
1. Go back to **OAuth** section in your Square Developer Dashboard
2. Look for any existing **"Access Tokens"** or **"Connected Merchants"** section
3. There might be an access token already generated from the "1 active token connected"

### Option 2: Create a Simple Personal Access Token Application
Since Bean Stalker needs direct API access, create a simpler application:

1. **Create New Application** in Square Developer Dashboard
2. Choose **"Personal Use"** or **"Direct API Access"** if available
3. This will give you a simple access token without OAuth complexity

### Option 3: Complete OAuth Authorization Flow
If you want to keep the current OAuth setup:

1. **Set up Redirect URL**: In OAuth section, set redirect URL to `https://member.beanstalker.com.au/auth/square`
2. **Authorize Your Own Business**: Go through the OAuth flow to authorize your own Square account
3. **Get Access Token**: After authorization, you'll get an access token

### Option 4: Use Square Application Directory
1. Go to **Square App Marketplace** (squareup.com/us/en/app-marketplace)
2. **"Manage Apps"** → **"My Apps"**
3. Look for existing access tokens or create a new simple app

## Recommended: Create Simple Personal Access Token App

For Bean Stalker's use case, a simple personal access token is better:

1. **New Application** → **"Personal Use"**
2. **Get Access Token** directly (no OAuth needed)
3. **Copy Token** (starts with `sq0atp-`)
4. **Update** `SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN_PROD` in Replit

## Why OAuth is Complicated for Bean Stalker
- OAuth is designed for third-party applications that connect to multiple merchants
- Bean Stalker only needs to connect to YOUR business
- Personal access tokens are simpler and more appropriate

## Quick Test: Try Sandbox Token Format
Let's verify the token format is correct. Your production token should:
- Start with `sq0atp-` (not `sq0idp-` which is Application ID)
- Be much longer than the Application ID
- Be different from the Application Secret

If your current token doesn't start with `sq0atp-`, that's the problem.
