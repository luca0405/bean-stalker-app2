### ðŸ”§ Common Configuration Issues

#### Issue: Products not appearing
**Cause**: App Store Connect API not properly connected
**Solution**: 
1. Generate new App Store Connect API key with "Developer" role
2. Add key to RevenueCat with correct Issuer ID and Key ID
3. Enable "Sync purchases" in RevenueCat

#### Issue: "Product not found" errors
**Cause**: Product IDs don't match between App Store Connect and RevenueCat
**Solution**:
1. Verify bundle ID matches exactly: `com.beanstalker.member`
2. Check product IDs are identical in both platforms
3. Ensure products are in "Ready to Submit" or "Developer Action Needed" status

#### Issue: Purchases fail in sandbox
**Cause**: Sandbox test user configuration
**Solution**:
1. Create dedicated sandbox test user
2. Never sign into sandbox account in iOS Settings
3. Only use sandbox credentials during purchase flow
