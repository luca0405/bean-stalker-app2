# RevenueCat IAP Diagnostic Check

## Current Error: "Payment system not available"

This error typically indicates one of several configuration issues:

### 1. RevenueCat Configuration Issues
- API key not properly configured in iOS app
- RevenueCat not properly initialized before purchase attempt
- User not logged in to RevenueCat with correct app_user_id

### 2. App Store Connect Issues
- Products not properly configured in App Store Connect
- Products still in "Draft" status (need to be "Ready for Review")
- Bundle ID mismatch between app and App Store Connect products

### 3. iOS Simulator vs Device Issues
- In-App Purchases don't work in iOS Simulator
- Must test on real device with TestFlight
- Sandbox Apple ID must be properly configured

### 4. Apple ID Configuration Issues
- Not signed in with sandbox Apple ID on device
- Sandbox Apple ID not properly created in App Store Connect
- Real Apple ID signed in instead of sandbox Apple ID

## Diagnostic Steps Required:

### Step 1: Check RevenueCat Initialization

- User login completes without errors
- Offerings are properly loaded

### Step 2: Verify Product Configuration

- Products are approved and "Ready for Review"
- Bundle ID matches exactly: com.beanstalker.member

### Step 3: Check Device Configuration
- Using real device (not simulator)
- Signed in with sandbox Apple ID
- TestFlight app installed (not development build)

### Step 4: Enhanced Error Handling
Add detailed error logging to identify exact failure point.
