# Bean Stalker - Coffee Shop Native Mobile App

## Overview

Bean Stalker is a full-stack native mobile application for a coffee shop, built with Capacitor for iOS and Android deployment. The app enables customers to browse menus, place orders, manage credits, and receive notifications. The application supports both customer and admin interfaces with real-time order tracking and payment processing.

**IMPORTANT: This is a NATIVE MOBILE APP, not a web application. All development decisions should prioritize native iOS/Android deployment via Capacitor, TestFlight, and App Store distribution.**

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between client and server components:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui styling
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theme support
- **State Management**: React Context API for cart, notifications, and app state
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **PWA Features**: Service Worker for offline support and push notifications

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with local strategy and session management
- **File Handling**: Multer for image uploads
- **Payment Processing**: Square API integration

## Key Components

### Database Layer

- **Primary Tables**:
  - `users`: User accounts with admin privileges and credit balances
  - `menuItems`: Product catalog with pricing and options
  - `orders`: Order history and status tracking
  - `menuCategories`: Organized menu sections
  - `pushSubscriptions`: Device notification endpoints

### Authentication System
- Session-based authentication with secure password hashing (scrypt)
- Role-based access control (admin/customer)
- Password reset functionality via email
- QR code generation for user identification

### Payment Integration
- Square Payment API for credit purchases
- Credit-based ordering system
- Transaction history tracking
- Administrative credit management

### Notification System

- Native biometric authentication
- Native push notifications via Capacitor Local Notifications
- RevenueCat In-App Purchase integration
- Native safe area handling for modern devices
- TestFlight and App Store distribution ready

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users log in through the auth page, establishing a session
2. **Menu Browsing**: Real-time menu data fetched from the database with category filtering
3. **Cart Management**: Client-side cart state with persistent storage
4. **Order Processing**: Cart items converted to database orders with credit deduction
5. **Notification Delivery**: Push notifications sent on order status changes
6. **Admin Management**: Separate admin interface for menu and user management

## External Dependencies

- **multer**: File upload handling

### Restaurant Management
- **Square for Restaurants API**: Enhanced order processing and kitchen management
- **Real-time Kitchen Display System**: Order status tracking and workflow management
- **Inventory Management**: Stock level monitoring and menu synchronization

### Development Tools
- **vite**: Build tool and development server
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for development
- **esbuild**: Production build bundling
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework

## Deployment Strategy

The application supports multiple deployment targets:

### Web Deployment (Replit)
- Development: `npm run dev` using tsx for hot reloading
- Production: `npm run build` creating optimized client and server bundles
- Database: `npm run db:push` for schema synchronization
- **Platform**: Replit autoscale deployment
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 module
- **Port Configuration**: Internal port 5000, external port 80
- **Environment**: Node.js 20 runtime

### Mobile App Deployment (Capacitor)
- **Framework**: Capacitor for native iOS and Android apps
- **Build Process**: `npm run build` followed by `npx cap sync`
- **iOS Testing**: Xcode simulator and device testing (Mac required)
- **Android Testing**: Android Studio emulator and device testing
- **Distribution**: App Store and Google Play Store ready

### File Structure
- `client/`: React frontend application
