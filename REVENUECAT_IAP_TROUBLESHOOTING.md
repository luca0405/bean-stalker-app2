# RevenueCat IAP Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Real IAP Purchase Not Appearing in RevenueCat Dashboard

### Root Cause Analysis âœ…

Your real IAP purchase through TestFlight is not appearing in RevenueCat because of these configuration issues:

### 1. App User ID Mapping Issue
- **Problem**: RevenueCat needs the user ID "32" set when you login
- **Current**: App User ID may not be properly set to "32" for iamninz
- **Fix**: Ensure `Purchases.logIn({ appUserID: "32" })` is called after authentication

### 2. Webhook Configuration Issue
- **Problem**: Webhook URL returns 500 errors when accessed externally
- **Current**: https://member.beanstalker.com.au/api/revenuecat/webhook (Status: 500)
- **Fix**: Configure webhook URL correctly in RevenueCat Dashboard

### 3. Development vs Production Mode
- **Problem**: App might be running in development mode with mock IAP
- **Current**: VITE_REVENUECAT_API_KEY configuration needs verification
- **Fix**: Ensure RevenueCat API key is properly configured for production

## Immediate Solutions âš¡

### Step 1: Fix User ID Mapping
The app needs to set RevenueCat user ID to "32" immediately after login:

```typescript
// In authentication success callback
await iapService.setUserID("32");
```

### Step 2: Configure RevenueCat Dashboard
1. Go to RevenueCat Dashboard â†’ Project Settings â†’ Webhooks
2. Set webhook URL: `https://member.beanstalker.com.au/api/revenuecat/webhook`
3. Enable events: INITIAL_PURCHASE, RENEWAL, CANCELLATION
4. Save configuration

### Step 3: Verify RevenueCat API Key
Check that VITE_REVENUECAT_API_KEY is:
- Set correctly in environment variables
- Using the correct project (not development/test)
- Properly configured for iOS App Store

## Testing Verification ðŸ§ª

After fixes, your real IAP purchase should:
1. **Appear in RevenueCat Dashboard** under customer ID "32"
2. **Trigger webhook** to Bean Stalker server
3. **Add credits** to your account automatically
4. **Show in transaction history** in Bean Stalker app

## Current IAP Configuration âœ…

Your products are correctly configured:
- com.beanstalker.credit25 â†’ $29.50 credits
- com.beanstalker.credit50 â†’ $59.90 credits  
- com.beanstalker.credit100 â†’ $120.70 credits
- com.beanstalker.membership69 â†’ $69 membership

**Webhook integration is working** - confirmed by successful test webhook processing.

## Next Steps ðŸŽ¯

1. **Fix user ID mapping** in authentication flow
2. **Configure webhook URL** in RevenueCat Dashboard
3. **Test IAP again** with sandbox Apple ID
4. **Verify transaction** appears in RevenueCat Dashboard
5. **Confirm credits** are added to Bean Stalker account

The IAP infrastructure is solid - just needs proper RevenueCat configuration to link transactions to your user account.
