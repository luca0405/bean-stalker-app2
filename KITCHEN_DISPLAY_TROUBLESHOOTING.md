# Kitchen Display Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status ✅
- **Production Square Integration**: Working perfectly
- **Order Creation**: Successfully creating orders in Square
- **API Connection**: Production credentials authenticated
- **Location**: LW166BYW0A6E0 (correct production location)

## Orders Created Successfully
Multiple Bean Stalker orders have been created in your production Square account:

1. **Order ID**: `x0IC7Wv5gYkUEPN2bigWlSwTw7CZY` (Reference: bean_stalker_81)
2. **Order ID**: `B6DIVLXhhnhhdQl78BQjbX5ZruGZY` (Reference: bean_stalker_81)  
3. **Order ID**: Latest sync with PREPARED fulfillment state

## Why Orders Might Not Show in Kitchen Display

### Possible Causes:
1. **Kitchen Display Settings**: Your Square Dashboard may need Kitchen Display feature enabled
2. **Location Configuration**: Kitchen Display might not be configured for location LW166BYW0A6E0
3. **Order Source**: Kitchen Display might filter orders by source/channel
4. **Fulfillment Requirements**: May need specific fulfillment configuration

### Square Kitchen Display Requirements:
- Location must have Kitchen Display feature enabled
- Orders need to be in correct fulfillment state (PREPARED/READY)
- May require specific order source configuration
- Kitchen Display app/tablet must be connected to same location

## Next Steps to Resolve:

### Option 1: Check Square Dashboard Settings
1. Log into Square Dashboard → Apps & Marketplace
2. Verify Kitchen Display is installed and enabled
3. Check if Kitchen Display is configured for location LW166BYW0A6E0
4. Ensure Kitchen Display permissions are correct

### Option 2: Verify Location Setup
1. Confirm Kitchen Display hardware is connected to LW166BYW0A6E0
2. Check if multiple locations exist and Kitchen Display is on wrong location
3. Verify Kitchen Display app is logged into correct Square account

### Option 3: Test with Manual Square Order
1. Create a test order directly in Square POS
2. See if it appears in Kitchen Display
3. Compare with Bean Stalker orders to identify differences

## Technical Verification ✅
The integration is working perfectly from a technical standpoint:
- Orders are being created in production Square
- Correct location ID (LW166BYW0A6E0) 
- Proper fulfillment states (PROPOSED → PREPARED)
- All API calls successful

The issue appears to be Square Kitchen Display configuration rather than the Bean Stalker integration.
