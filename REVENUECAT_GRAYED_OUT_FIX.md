# RevenueCat "Make Default" Grayed Out - Troubleshooting

## Issue: Cannot Click "Make Default"

When "Make Default" is grayed out, it typically means:

### 1. **Offering Validation Issues**
- Missing required packages
- Invalid package configurations
- Product linking problems

### 2. **Possible Fixes to Try**

#### Option A: Check All Packages Are Valid
1. Click on the "default" offering to open it
2. Go to the **Packages** tab
3. Verify all 4 packages are properly configured:
   - Package identifier exists
   - Product is linked correctly
   - No error indicators

#### Option B: Edit and Save Offering
1. Click **Edit** on the default offering
2. Make a small change (like adding a space to description)
3. Click **Save**
4. Try "Make Default" again

#### Option C: Check App Configuration
1. Go to RevenueCat Dashboard → **Apps & providers**
2. Select your **Beanstalker** app
3. Verify the app is properly configured and not in draft mode

#### Option D: Create New Offering (If Others Fail)
1. Click **"+ New offering"**
2. Name it "current"
3. Add all 4 packages with same identifiers:
   - credit_25 → com.beanstalker.credit25
   - credit_50 → com.beanstalker.credit50  
   - credit_100 → com.beanstalker.credit100
   - membership → com.beanstalker.membership69
4. Set this new offering as default

### 3. **Most Likely Issue**
The offering might be missing some required configuration or have validation errors that aren't immediately visible.

## Immediate Next Step

Can you click on the "default" offering to open it and show me the **Packages** tab? I want to see if all 4 packages are properly configured or if there are any error indicators.

If that doesn't work, we can create a fresh offering with the correct configuration.
