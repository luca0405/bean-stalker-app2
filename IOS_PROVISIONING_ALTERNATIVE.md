# Alternative iOS Build Approach

Since we're having persistent issues with provisioning profiles, let me suggest trying the alternative workflow I created:

## Option 1: Use the Simple Workflow
I created `.github/workflows/ios-testflight-simple.yml` which uses a different approach:
- Uses plutil instead of grep for parsing provisioning profiles
- Has better error handling
- Configures signing in a more reliable way

To use this:
1. Rename current workflow: `ios-testflight.yml` → `ios-testflight-backup.yml` 
2. Rename new workflow: `ios-testflight-simple.yml` → `ios-testflight.yml`

## Option 2: Try Manual xcconfig Approach
I also created `ios/App/Manual.xcconfig` which forces manual signing configuration.

## Option 3: Verify Your Provisioning Profile
Let's check if your provisioning profile is correct:

1. Download your profile from Apple Developer Portal
2. Open Terminal and check it:
```bash
security cms -D -i YourProfile.mobileprovision | grep -A5 "application-identifier"
```

It should show: `com.beanstalker.member`

## Option 4: Create New Profile
If the profile is wrong, create a new one:
1. Go to: https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles/add
2. Type: App Store Distribution  
3. Bundle ID: com.beanstalker.member
4. Certificate: Your iOS Distribution certificate
5. Download and update the GitHub secret

Which approach would you like to try first?
