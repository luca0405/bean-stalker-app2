# FOUND THE ISSUE: No Current Offering Set

## Root Cause Confirmed
Your screenshot shows the "default" offering exists with 4 packages, but there's **no "Current" badge** next to it. This means RevenueCat doesn't know which offering to use, causing the "offerings configuration" error.

## Immediate Fix Required

### Step 1: Set Default as Current Offering
1. In your RevenueCat Dashboard → Offerings page (where you are now)
2. Click the **"..." (Actions)** button next to the "default" offering
3. Look for **"Set as Current"** option in the dropdown menu
4. Click it to make "default" the current offering

### Step 2: Verify Current Status
After setting it as current, you should see:
- ✅ **"Current" badge** appears next to "default" offering
- ✅ The offering row may be highlighted or marked differently

### Step 3: Test Immediately
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for changes to propagate
2. Open TestFlight app and run diagnostic again
3. Should now show: **"✅ RevenueCat API Call: SUCCESS"**

## Expected Result After Fix

Your TestFlight diagnostic should change from:
```
❌ RevenueCat API Call: FAILED
Error: There is an issue with your offerings configuration
```

To:
```
✅ RevenueCat API Call: SUCCESS
Total offerings found: 1
Current offering: default
Available offerings: default
Products extracted: 4
```

## Why This Happens
RevenueCat requires one offering to be designated as "Current" so the SDK knows which products to show. Without a current offering set, the API returns a configuration error even if the offering exists and has all the correct products.

This is a simple toggle fix that will resolve the entire IAP issue immediately.
