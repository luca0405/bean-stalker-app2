If a Square payment link is not redirecting to a website after a successful payment using the API, the issue likely lies in the configuration of the redirect URL within your Square API integration or the handling of the redirect on your website's end.
Key areas to examine:
Callback URL Configuration:
Ensure that the redirect_url parameter in your Square API request (e.g., when creating a checkout link) is correctly set to the desired URL on your website. This URL is where Square will send the customer back after the payment is completed.
Verify that the callback URL uses HTTPS, as this is a requirement for Square's redirect functionality.
API Response Handling:
Confirm that your application is correctly processing the response from Square after the payment is made. This response may contain information about the transaction status and the redirect URL.
If you are using the Checkout API, be aware of the url and long_url parameters. Using long_url is often recommended if you are quickly redirecting right after the API call, as it can help prevent users from encountering an error page due to premature redirection.
Website's Redirect Logic:
Examine the code on your website at the specified redirect_url to ensure it is properly configured to handle the incoming request from Square and initiate the final redirection to the desired page.
If you are testing in a local environment, consider using a service like ngrok to expose your local environment to the internet, allowing Square to properly redirect to your local server.
Timing Considerations:
In some cases, there might be a slight delay before the transaction is fully processed and available for retrieval by your system. If you are attempting to retrieve transaction details immediately after redirection, consider introducing a small delay to ensure the data is ready.
By addressing these points, you can troubleshoot and resolve the issue of Square payment links not redirecting correctly after successful payments using the API.
