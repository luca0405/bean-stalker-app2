# RevenueCat Troubleshooting - Still 0 Products

## Issue: Products "Ready to Submit" but RevenueCat Still Finds 0 Products

Even after setting all 4 products to "Ready to Submit" status, RevenueCat is still returning 0 products. This indicates a deeper configuration issue.

## Enhanced Diagnostic Information

I've updated the diagnostic tool to provide much more detailed information:
- Total offerings found
- Current offering details
- All available offerings
- Package details for each offering
- Product information (title, price, ID)
- Customer info

## Possible Root Causes

### 1. **App Store Connect Integration Issue**
- RevenueCat may not be properly connected to App Store Connect
- API key might be incorrect or missing permissions
- Bundle ID mismatch at a deeper level

### 2. **Offering Configuration Missing**
- Products exist but not added to any offering in RevenueCat Dashboard
- "default" offering doesn't exist or is empty
- Offering exists but with different name

### 3. **App Store Connect Propagation Delay**
- Changes can take 2-24 hours to propagate fully
- Sandbox environment might need more time

### 4. **RevenueCat App Configuration**
- Wrong app selected in RevenueCat Dashboard
- Products might be configured for different bundle ID

## Next Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Run Enhanced Diagnostic
The updated diagnostic will show exactly what RevenueCat sees:
```
=== RevenueCat Offerings Debug ===
Total offerings: X
Current offering: [name or None]
Available offerings: [list]

=== Current Offering Details ===
[Detailed package information]
```

### Step 2: Check RevenueCat Dashboard Offerings
1. Go to RevenueCat Dashboard → Offerings
2. Verify "default" offering exists
3. Verify it contains all 4 products
4. Check offering is active/published

### Step 3: Verify App Store Connect Integration
1. RevenueCat Dashboard → Apps → [Your App]
2. Check "App Store Connect Integration" section
3. Verify API key is correct and has permissions

### Step 4: Manual Product Check
Test if RevenueCat can fetch products directly:
```javascript
await Purchases.getProducts(['com.beanstalker.credit25']);
```

## Expected Enhanced Diagnostic Output

**If Working:**
```
Total offerings: 1
Current offering: default
=== Current Offering Details ===
Packages: 4
  1. credit_25 → com.beanstalker.credit25 ($25.00)
  2. credit_50 → com.beanstalker.credit50 ($50.00)
  3. credit_100 → com.beanstalker.credit100 ($100.00)
  4. membership → com.beanstalker.membership69 ($69.00)
```

**If Still Broken:**
```
Total offerings: 0
Current offering: None
Available offerings: None
```

This will pinpoint the exact issue location.
