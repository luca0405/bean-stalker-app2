# iOS Build Signing Configuration Fix

## Issue Identified
The build fails with a signing conflict:
```
App has conflicting provisioning settings. App is automatically signed for development, but a conflicting code signing identity iPhone Distribution has been manually specified.
```

## Root Cause
The iOS project has mixed signing configuration:
- **Automatic signing** is enabled 
- **Manual code signing identity** "iPhone Distribution" is specified
- This creates a conflict that prevents building

## Solution Applied
The new workflow fixes this by:
1. **Clearing manual signing identity** with `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=""`
2. **Clearing provisioning profile** with `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER=""`
3. **Using pure automatic signing** with `CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Automatic`
4. **Letting App Store Connect API** handle certificate selection

## Build Parameters Used
```bash
CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Automatic
CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=""
PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER=""
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=A43TZWNYA3
```

## Why This Works
- **Automatic signing** lets Xcode choose the right certificate
- **Admin API key** downloads your existing certificates
- **No manual overrides** prevents conflicts
- **App Store Connect API** handles provisioning profiles

## Next Steps
Run **"iOS Build - Fixed Signing Configuration"** workflow which resolves the signing conflict and should complete the build successfully.
