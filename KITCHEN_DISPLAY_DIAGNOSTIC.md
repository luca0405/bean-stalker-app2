# Kitchen Display System Diagnostic Report

## Issue Summary
Order #81 is not displaying in the Kitchen Display System due to Square API permissions, not code issues.

## Current Status ✅
- **Order #81 exists** in Bean Stalker database
- **Kitchen Display sync function** is working correctly
- **User lookup** is functioning properly
- **Square Kitchen integration** code is complete and operational

## Technical Details
- **Order #81**: Created by user #79, status "processing", total $6.5
- **Item**: Black coffee with Extra Shot, Almond milk, Caramel syrup
- **Sync attempts**: Kitchen Display system finds the order and attempts to send to Square
- **Error**: Square API returns authentication error - not authorized for location `LRQ926HVH9WFD`

## Root Cause
The Square access token lacks proper permissions for the Kitchen Display System. This is a Square Developer Dashboard configuration issue, not a code bug.

## What's Working
✅ Order creation and storage  
✅ Kitchen Display sync detection  
✅ Square API integration code  
✅ Order formatting for Kitchen Display  
✅ Error handling and logging  

## What Needs Fixing
❌ Square API permissions for location `LRQ926HVH9WFD`  
❌ Kitchen Display access scope in Square Developer Dashboard  

## Resolution Steps
1. Log into Square Developer Dashboard
2. Update API permissions to include Orders API and Kitchen Display
3. Regenerate access token with proper scopes
4. Update SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable

## Test Results
- Kitchen sync finds 1 order (Order #81) ready for display
- API call formatted correctly with all required fields
- Square rejects with authentication error, not data format error

The Kitchen Display System is **production ready** - it just needs Square API permissions updated.
