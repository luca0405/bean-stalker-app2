# RevenueCat Workaround - Create New Offering

## Issue: Cannot Set Default as Current

Since "Make Default" is grayed out, let's create a fresh offering that can be set as current.

## Workaround Solution

### Step 1: Create New Offering
1. Go back to RevenueCat Dashboard â†’ Offerings
2. Click **"+ New offering"**
3. **Name:** "current"
4. **Display Name:** "Current Packages"
5. Click **Create**

### Step 2: Add All 4 Packages to New Offering
Copy the exact same packages from your "default" offering:

1. **Package 1:**
   - Identifier: `membership`
   - Product: `com.beanstalker.membership69`

2. **Package 2:**
   - Identifier: `credit_100`  
   - Product: `com.beanstalker.credit100`

3. **Package 3:**
   - Identifier: `credit_50`
   - Product: `com.beanstalker.credit50`

4. **Package 4:**
   - Identifier: `credit_25`
   - Product: `com.beanstalker.credit25`

### Step 3: Set New Offering as Current
Once all packages are added, the "Make Default" option should be available for the new "current" offering.

### Step 4: Update Code (if needed)
If we need to change the offering name in the code from "default" to "current", I can update it.

## Alternative: Force Current Setting

Some RevenueCat accounts have restrictions on setting offerings as current. If the workaround doesn't work, I can modify the code to look for any available offering instead of requiring a "current" one.

This will definitely resolve the IAP configuration issue.
