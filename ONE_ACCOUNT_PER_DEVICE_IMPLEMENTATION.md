# One Account Per Device Implementation

## Strategy Overview
Implement a secure device-bound authentication system where each device can only have one active Bean Stalker account, optimized for Apple Wallet credit integration.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Device Registration System
- Generate unique device identifier using Capacitor Device API
- Store device ID in user account during registration/first login
- Prevent multiple accounts from being created/accessed on same device

### 2. Automatic Login After Registration
- Remove login page after successful registration
- Automatically authenticate user for app lifetime
- Use biometric authentication for security

### 3. Account Management
- "Switch Account" becomes "Logout & Register New Account"
- Clear all device data when switching accounts
- Reset biometric credentials and RevenueCat user ID

### 4. Enhanced Security
- Device-bound encryption for stored credentials
- Automatic session management
- Secure Apple Wallet integration preparation

## Benefits for Apple Wallet Integration
- Guaranteed user identity for wallet passes
- Simplified credit balance synchronization
- Enhanced security for financial transactions
- Streamlined user experience
