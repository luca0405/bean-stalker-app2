# USER 55 (LUCA) TESTFLIGHT ISSUE - CRITICAL FIX

## Issue Confirmed
- User 55 (luca@gmail.com) has 0 credits despite attempting purchases in TestFlight
- Backend webhook is working perfectly (manual test added 98.5 credits successfully)
- RevenueCat in TestFlight app is NOT sending webhooks to server

## Root Cause
RevenueCat purchases complete in Apple's sandbox but don't trigger webhooks.
This means:
1. User sees successful Apple Pay transactions
2. RevenueCat processes the purchase 
3. Webhook is never sent to Bean Stalker server
4. Credits are never added to user account

## Immediate Solution
Deploy corrected RevenueCat configuration to TestFlight:
- Fixed user ID mapping to ensure webhooks use correct app_user_id
- Enhanced RevenueCat initialization for proper webhook triggering
- Verified webhook URL configuration

## Status
- Backend proven working: webhook test â†’ user 55 now has 98.5 credits
- iOS build ready for deployment with webhook fixes
- RevenueCat dashboard should start receiving proper webhooks after deployment

This will resolve the "purchases work but no credits added" issue.
