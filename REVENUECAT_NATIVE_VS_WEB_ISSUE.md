# RevenueCat Native vs Web Issue Resolution

## Issue Identified
- ✅ **Web browser**: Products load successfully
- ❌ **Native iOS**: Products show "0 products"

This indicates a **platform-specific configuration issue**, not a RevenueCat API problem.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Most Likely Causes (In Order)

#### 1. **Bundle ID Mismatch** (Most Common)
- **RevenueCat Dashboard**: App configured with wrong bundle ID
- **Expected**: com.beanstalker.member
- **Check**: RevenueCat → Project Settings → Apps → Bundle ID

#### 2. **Sandbox Environment Issues**
- **TestFlight**: Uses sandbox App Store environment
- **Requirement**: Valid sandbox Apple ID (different from main account)
- **Check**: Settings → App Store → Sign Out → Use sandbox account

#### 3. **App Store Connect Product Status**
- **Status**: Products must be "Ready to Submit"
- **Issue**: Products might be "Waiting for Review" or "Developer Action Needed"
- **Check**: App Store Connect → In-App Purchases

#### 4. **In-App Purchase Key Permissions**
- **Integration**: StoreKit 2 requires proper key permissions
- **Issue**: Key might lack transaction data access
- **Check**: RevenueCat Dashboard → App Settings → In-App Purchase Key

## Immediate Fixes Applied

### 1. **Enhanced StoreKit 2 Configuration**
```typescript
await Purchases.configure({
  apiKey,
  appUserID: undefined,
  usesStoreKit2IfAvailable: true, // Force StoreKit 2 for iOS 15+
});
```

### 2. **Platform-Specific Diagnostic**
Enhanced diagnostic now shows:
- Bundle ID verification
- StoreKit version detection  
- Platform-specific troubleshooting
- Native vs web comparison

## Next Steps

### 1. **Deploy Enhanced Diagnostic**
- Run GitHub Actions to deploy SDK 11.0.0 + enhanced native diagnostic
- Test in TestFlight with detailed platform analysis

### 2. **Verify Bundle ID Match**
- Check RevenueCat dashboard app configuration
- Ensure exact match: com.beanstalker.member

### 3. **Sandbox Account Testing**
- Sign out of main Apple ID in iOS Settings
- Use sandbox account for TestFlight testing
- Verify sandbox environment is active

### 4. **App Store Connect Status Check**
- Confirm all 4 products are "Ready to Submit"
- No pending reviews or developer actions required

## Expected Resolution

Once the bundle ID and sandbox configuration are correct, the enhanced diagnostic should show:
```
Platform: Native iOS/Android
Bundle ID: com.beanstalker.member
StoreKit Version: StoreKit 2 (iOS 15+)
Total offerings found: 1
Offerings: default
Packages: 4
```

The native iOS app will then load products identically to the web version.

## Key Insight

Web success proves RevenueCat API, credentials, and product configuration are correct. The issue is purely iOS native platform configuration, which is much easier to fix than API integration problems.
