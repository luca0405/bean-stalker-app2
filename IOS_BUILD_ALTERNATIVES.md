# iOS Build - Alternative Solutions

We've been going in circles with provisioning profile issues. Here are proven alternatives:

## Option 1: Fastlane Approach (Recommended)
I've created `.github/workflows/ios-testflight-fastlane.yml` that uses Fastlane, which handles all the signing complexity for us:

**Advantages:**
- Fastlane handles keychain management automatically
- Proper provisioning profile installation
- Reliable App Store Connect integration
- Used by thousands of iOS apps in CI/CD

**To use:**
1. Rename current workflow to backup
2. Use the fastlane workflow instead

## Option 2: Manual Xcode Project Fix
The root issue might be that the Xcode project itself has conflicting settings. We could:
1. Reset the iOS project completely
2. Configure it properly for both automatic and manual signing
3. Use build-time overrides only

## Option 3: Use Xcode Cloud Instead
Since GitHub Actions keeps having provisioning issues, we could:
1. Configure Xcode Cloud (Apple's official CI/CD)
2. Connect it to your GitHub repo
3. Use Apple's native build system

## Option 4: Local Build Script
Create a script you can run locally:
1. Build archive locally
2. Upload to TestFlight from your Mac
3. Avoid CI/CD signing issues entirely

## Recommendation
Let's try the Fastlane approach first. It's the most reliable for iOS CI/CD and handles all the signing complexity automatically.
