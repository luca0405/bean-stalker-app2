# RevenueCat Offering Activation Steps

## Current Status
From your screenshot, I can see:
- ✅ "default" offering exists
- ✅ Has packages configured
- ❓ Need to verify if it's set as CURRENT offering

## Step-by-Step Activation

### Step 1: Check Current Offering Status
1. In your RevenueCat Dashboard, go back to **Offerings** main page
2. Look for a **"Current"** label or checkmark next to the "default" offering
3. If there's no "Current" indicator, the offering is not active

### Step 2: Set as Current Offering
1. On the **Offerings** page, find the "default" offering
2. Look for an **"Set as Current"** button or toggle
3. Click it to make "default" the current offering
4. You should see a "Current" badge appear

### Step 3: Verify Package Configuration
From your screenshot, I can see you have:
- **"Beanstalker Membership"** package with identifier **"member-ship"**

**CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED:** Your package identifier is **"member-ship"** but my code expects **"membership"**.

## Immediate Fix Required

### Option 1: Update Package Identifier in RevenueCat
1. Click **Edit** on the "default" offering
2. Change package identifier from **"member-ship"** to **"membership"**
3. Save changes

### Option 2: Update Code to Match Your Package IDs
I can update the code to match your current package identifiers.

## Package Identifier Mismatch
**Your RevenueCat Dashboard:** "member-ship"
**My Code Expects:** "membership"

This mismatch could be causing the offerings error. Let me check what other package identifiers you have configured and update the code accordingly.

## Expected Package Identifiers
Based on the code, these should be:
- credit_25 → com.beanstalker.credit25
- credit_50 → com.beanstalker.credit50  
- credit_100 → com.beanstalker.credit100
- membership → com.beanstalker.membership69

Please check if your other packages match these identifiers or share a screenshot of all packages.
